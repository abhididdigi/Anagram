Sample Usage:

Download the repo, extract it in the same folder, and then run

`node anagram.js <word_you_want_to_get_anagram_of>`

If you have a new data set for dictionary, run the following files in the exact same order. Remember to replace your data set with the file `wordlist.txt`

1. `node index.js`
2. `node normalize.js`
3. `node anagram.js <word>`



I coded this program in Hanging Lake, CO, USA.
